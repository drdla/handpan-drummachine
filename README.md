# Handpan Drummachine

A technical prototype for a drum machine version of a handpan.

## Running the app

This app is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Running the app is totally standard:

Better switch your node version based on the .nvrmrc file to prevent anything funky from happening.

Install the app's dependencies

```sh
  $ npm i
```

and then start the app with

```sh
 $ npm run dev
```

It will run the application in development mode and open your browser on `localhost:3000`.

## Used technologies

Vite, Typescript, zustand & immer, Tone.js, ...
